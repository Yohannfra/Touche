## Print settings

I printed all parts with **0.2 layer height** and **20% infill**.

I printed them all on my ender 3 pro so I don't think any of them can be considered as a difficult print.

You'll need supports for the **client's base** and the **server's base**.

You can print in any color but should print the server light diffuser in white for better results.

You can print in any material.

## Print time

This is just to give you an idea of the print time I had on my **ender 3 pro** at **50 mm/s** (and most of Cura's defaults settings) for PLA

| Part        | Time  |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Client base | ~6h |
| Client lid  | ~4h    |
| Server base | ~7h    |
| Server lid  | ~4h |
| Light diffuser| 5 min |
