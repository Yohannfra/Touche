## Order the PCBs

Check the chapter about the PCB ordering in the [Assembly guide](../../Assembly_Guide/README.md)

## Quick note

I designed these PCBs with Eagle.

The Arduino nano and NRF24L01 parts come from here: https://www.diymodules.org/

I learned PCB with this project so they may not be perfect.

Please open an issue if you spot any design error.
