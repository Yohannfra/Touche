# Step 1 : Client's PCB



This first step is for soldering everything onto the client's pcb. Since there are 2 clients you'll need to **do this step twice**.



1. Take the client's pcb

2. Take the Arduino Nano (and solder the leads if needed)

3. Solder the Arduino Nano on the pcb

4. Take the NRF24L01 and solder it on the pcb

5. Take the 10uF capacitor and solder it (be careful, it's a polarized capacitor and therefore the positive side must match the little + on the pcb)

6. take the 3 220 ohms resistors and solder them

7. Take the 10k ohms resistor and solder it

8. Take the 2 1M ohms resistors and solder them

9. Take the RGB led and solder it. Be careful, of the side and place it like on the picture before soldering. Once soldered, bend the leads like on the pictures.

10. Flip the pcb and cut all the leads

11. Take one of the lead and solder it across the empty resistor slot.

And ... Done ! Now repeat all these steps a second time for the second pcb. At the end you should have two pcbs like that:
