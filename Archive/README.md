This directory contains the code of some early prototypes I did. I don't know if they work or even compile.
I keep this directory just to keep trace of these old prototypes.

**esp32_arduino_v1** and **esp32_espidf_v2** were made to run on Espressif ESP32 chip and used ESP-NOW.
Around the end of the v2, I realized that the ESP32 consumed way too much power and started over with Arduino nano.

The v1 coded with the Arduino framework and the v2 with the ESP-IDF framework.
