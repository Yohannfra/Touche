This directory contains the code of some early prototypes and versions of this project.

I keep this directory just to keep track of these old prototypes.

- [esp32_arduino_v1](./esp32_arduino_v1) was made to run on ESP32 and coded with arduino
I stopped developping this version when I realised that most of the code I will need to use was in ESP-IDF.

- [esp32_espidf_v2](esp32_espidf_v2) was made to run on ESP32 chip and coded ESP-IDF
Around the end of the v2, I realized that the ESP32 consumed way too much power and started over with Arduino nano.

- [touche_v1](touche_v1) is the the first version of this project that I released in 2020, it has code, 3d files and pcbs.

  I stopped this because the hack I used for the virtual ground was not working at all and won't work.

  Otherwise everything should work out of the box.
